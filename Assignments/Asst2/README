notes and assumptions:
I was not able to get tands.c and prodcon.cpp to link properly so I just added the code
from tands.c to my prodcon.cpp file without changing any of the code in tands.c

sometimes the end of the printing to log file may not work and the code will get stuck in a loop
if this happens please just rerun the code.  it should fix the issue

sometimes some of the print statements may look not like what is expected.  I was not able to fix
this issue.  Please rerun the code and it should fix the issue.
