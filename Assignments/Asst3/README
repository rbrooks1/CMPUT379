Assignment: CMPUT379 Assignment 3 server-client code

running instructions:
See man pages for instructions on how to run.

Notes and Assumptions:
I was not able to get tands.c to work as a seperate file so I put the Trans function in the server
code and the Sleep function in the client code, but I also added a line of code to add to TransSave
in the client code.
The server must be run in the same terminal as the terminal in which you compiled your code or
the server and client will get hung up on the first piece of work sent from the client to the server.
This hangup may also occur if the client is run to late after the server is started (I'm honestly not sure
why this happens).  If this issue occurs simply try rerunning the server and client or try recompiling
the code with the given makefile.
To use the man pages developed for this assignment simply run the command groff -Tascii -man <server/client>.man | more
and to exit the man page simply hit the q key on your keyboard.
